\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion} 
With increasing the center of mass energy of the colliders, pair production of the heavy charged bosons, \wprime bosons, can be accessible. The events selection efficiencies, provided by a CMS analysis in a similar final state enables us to approximate the detector effects without the complexities from the full detector response simulation. The efficiencies are used to find the yield of the favorite signal. A statistical tool can compare the yield of the signal with the observed events from data and set a lower limit on the mass of the \wprime boson. Different 
scenarios for the coupling of \wprime bosons to leptons is examined and the corresponding lower limits are reported...
