Report on W’ pair production in the light of CMS searches” by S. Paktinat & L. Zamiri.
General comments:
This article presents the reinterpretation of one of CMS Collaboration searches, in terms of the
production of a pair of W’ bosons, where these new particles are hypothetical new bosons
appearing in extensions of the Standard Model (SM). In lack of significant deviations from the
SM prediction, the study is used to constraint the mass/couplings to SM fermions of the new
particles. The final state studied by CMS consists of events with two τ leptons + missing
transverse momentum, which in the CMS paper is interpreted in terms of the electroweak
production of a pair of charginos or tau sleptons.
It is an interesting paper, as it considers for the first time, the production of a pair of W’
bosons from pp collisions, decaying into leptons of the third family, which play an important
role in some new physics models. Experimental searches for new heavy bosons in ATLAS or
CMS have focused on the production of a single particle, decaying into a variety of final states
(leptons, quarks, bosons). None in terms of production of a pair of heavy bosons, Since the
assumed coupling of the W’ to the quarks in the proton would be the same for producing 1
boson (s-channel) or 2 bosons (t-channel) the immediate searches consider the possibility of
having enough energy to produce 1 boson, not 2.
In summary, I consider the article is worth being published.
There are some comments/questions in the following, before proceeding for publication.
Particular/Specific comments:
Page 3 L26:”the tail of the lepton transverse mass distribution”.
It is the transverse mass distribution of the lepton + neutrino system, or, experimentally
talking, the lepton + missing transverse momentum system.
Page 3 L30: Related to the comment above: “associated with missing transverse energy
coming from a neutrino”. Since you talk later about missing transverse momentum (not
energy), it would be better to be consistent here and say “associated with missing transverse
momentum coming from a neutrino”.
In case of wanting/needing to use “missing transverse energy” one should defined first the
missing transverse momentum as the (negative) vectorial sum of particles’ momenta, being
the missing transverse energy its modulus.
Page 3 L52: “μ lepton or an electron”: why not calling simply “muon or an electron”?
Page 5 L3-5: Signal modelling:
Does the model used for W’ signal generation include interference effects between the SM W
and the W’ bosons?
Have you compared differences in W’ cross sections values and/or shape of distributions
predicted by the NLO generator used and a LO one, such as Pythia, which is the one used by
CMS and ATLAS collaborations in W’ searches?
